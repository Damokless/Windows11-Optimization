# ðŸ“– Description
### Hello everyone and welcome to this repository!
You can find all the commands, scripts, registry keys, configuration, tutorials and more that I use to optimize my Windows 10 to get the best performance from my PC

# âš  Important notes

### 1) Don't forget to run all scripts as administrator, it's important to have the necessary access for the scripts to work at their best

### 2) I do not guarantee personal support and I am not responsible if you have a problem. If a problem is recurrent I will be happy to make the changes myself 

# Enable execution of powershell scripts
Open a powershell window as administrator and run the following command
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
