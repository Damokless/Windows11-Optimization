>I recently installed windows 11, it will be necessary to be patient for the wikis (they arrive soon)
# üìñ Description
### Hello everyone and welcome to this repository üëã!
You can find all the commands, scripts, registry keys, configuration, tutorials and more that I use to optimize my Windows 10/11 to get the best performance from my PC

# ‚ö† Important notes

### 1. Don't forget to run all scripts as administrator, it's important to have the necessary access for the scripts to work at their best

### 2. I do not guarantee personal support and I am not responsible if you have a problem. If a problem is recurrent I will be happy to make the changes myself
